        <p>This page is a sandbox to experiment a bit with lists.
            I have no idea if this is the right way to go about learning 
            how to use html, but I guess it's part of the fun. 
            Figuring out strategies that work for me when it comes to 
            learning how to design websites.

        <ol type="i"> 
            <h4>This is an ordered list</h4>
            <li>This is a placeholder for the first item</li>
            <li>How about a second one?</li>
            <li>Or a third one, let's go wild</li>
            <ul>
                <h4>This is an unordered list nested inside the ordered one.</h4>
                <li>Maybe one day this list will serve a utility</li>
                <li>For now these are simply placeholder values</li>
            </ul>
