        <h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
        <h2>The start of a wonderful journey</h2>
        <hr>

        <h3>The first step</h3>
        <p>This section marks, in part, the very beginning of my journey in web development.
            I have always been interested in designing my own website, but failed to find the motivation
            amidst the myriad of computer science topics to learn from. Nevertheless this section is simply
            a paceholder for any purpose I may make out of this webiste in the future.
        </p>

        <h3>The sandbox</h3>
        <p>Essentially, this website is a sandbox. It serves as an archive for my past achivements
            in web development, however small, and hopefully will result in an interesting experience as the 
            complexity ramps up.
        </p>

        <h3>What have I learnt so far?</h3>
        <p>For now, the initial webpage is predominantly made of html headers, paragraphs, hr and br. 
            The goal is to understand the basics of html and progressively expend my knowledge, in HTML, CSS, 
            Javascript, NodeJs, SQL, MongoDB, React and maybe a backend framework such as C# or SpringBoot. 
            It is overall a project that aims to give me the basic tools to gain experience in full stack 
            development.
        </p>

        <h3>What is next?</h3>
        <p>With every new bit of knowledge, I will slowly build this website using what I have learnt.
            Hopefully this website will grow to be interesting to look at/interact with. I will add new sections
            dedicated to specific concepts.
        </p>

        <p>Here are some pages to check out on my website:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="./lists.html">My experience with Lists</a></li>
            <li><a href="./public/about.html">About me</a></li>
            <li><a href="./public/contact.html">How to contact me</a></li>
        </ul>
